# whisper-rs
# THIS version change it to suit Android device

Rust bindings to [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/)

## Usage

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs.git

cd whisper-rs

cargo run --example basic_use

cargo run --example audio_transcription
```

```rust
use whisper_rs::{WhisperContext, WhisperContextParameters, FullParams, SamplingStrategy};

fn main() {
    let path_to_model = std::env::args().nth(1).unwrap();

    // load a context and model
    let ctx = WhisperContext::new_with_params(
        path_to_model,
        WhisperContextParameters::default()
    ).expect("failed to load model");

    // create a params object
    let params = FullParams::new(SamplingStrategy::Greedy { best_of: 1 });

    // assume we have a buffer of audio data
    // here we'll make a fake one, floating point samples, 32 bit, 16KHz, mono
    let audio_data = vec![0_f32; 16000 * 2];

    // now we can run the model
    let mut state = ctx.create_state().expect("failed to create state");
    state
        .full(params, &audio_data[..])
        .expect("failed to run model");

    // fetch the results
    let num_segments = state
        .full_n_segments()
        .expect("failed to get number of segments");
    for i in 0..num_segments {
        let segment = state
            .full_get_segment_text(i)
            .expect("failed to get segment");
        let start_timestamp = state
            .full_get_segment_t0(i)
            .expect("failed to get segment start timestamp");
        let end_timestamp = state
            .full_get_segment_t1(i)
            .expect("failed to get segment end timestamp");
        println!("[{} - {}]: {}", start_timestamp, end_timestamp, segment);
    }
}
```

See [examples/basic_use.rs](examples/basic_use.rs) for more details.

Lower level bindings are exposed if needed, but the above should be enough for most use cases.
See the docs: https://docs.rs/whisper-rs/ for more details.

## Building

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for instructions for building whisper-rs on Windows and OSX M1. Linux builds should just work out of the box.

## Troubleshooting

* Something other than Windows/macOS/Linux isn't working!
  * I don't have a way to test these platforms, so I can't really help you.
    * If you can get it working, please open a PR with any changes to make it work and build instructions in BUILDING.md!
* I get a panic during binding generation build!
  * You can attempt to fix it yourself, or you can set the `WHISPER_DONT_GENERATE_BINDINGS` environment variable.
    This skips attempting to build the bindings whatsoever and copies the existing ones. They may be out of date,
    but it's better than nothing.
    * `WHISPER_DONT_GENERATE_BINDINGS=1 cargo build`
  * If you can fix the issue, please open a PR!
